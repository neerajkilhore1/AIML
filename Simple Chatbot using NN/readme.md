The project requires you to have good knowledge of Python, Keras, and Natural language processing (NLTK).

Internal Working:
In this Python project , we are going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques.
The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. 
We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to 
and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

Requirement:
Python 3.7
tensorflow 2.0.0
Keras 2.4.3
NLTK : 3.5

Installation
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install pickle ( present in python 3.7 . No need to install separatly)
pip install nltk
